Hi, I’m @zachbakerdev

I’m interested in front-end and back-end web development and have experience with React.js for front-ends and Express.js for back-ends.

I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source projects. I want to give back to the communities that have made my learning possible.

Email me at [zach@zachbaker.dev](mailto:zach@zachbaker.dev).
